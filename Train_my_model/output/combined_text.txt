Scott is m-f Gemma/her folks gets the weekend Yep She didn’t lose rights Oh interesting So it's status quo Pretty much Taking away rights is harsh Yeah I agree. She is lower case messed up but not Capital letters lol More legal fees and logistics in the future Hopefully she gets her shit together. By first apologizing not only to her brother but also her parents Yeah idk about that lol Jun was r realistic He knows she may just go back to her old ways So practical! Might just be lip service I guess Gemma works Fridays so her parents still have to watch Aurora And the judge wants them to put her in a daycare that’s more equidistant Oh interesting Let me look in LinkedIn lol She works for a lab or some thing To Gemma’s credit her linked in is always accurate 🤣 She works at CVS! Lolllll Also idk whose house those thanksgiving pics that myr posted on Facebook were taken at but it’s really nice Oh I didn't see it It’s super fancy!

Was Gemma even around this weekend? Good god She seems okay Prolly not Yeah my mom said she doesn’t want to get her other hip replaced 🤷🏽‍♀️ Ohhh I think she had a bad experience with the first hip replacement Ohhh That's awful Do bad hips run in the family? Yeah I think there must be a genetic component. That’s what Aurora had Oh lord. I have to get it checked out. I injured my hip recently Those at highest risk are usually first born females, strangely Hmmm Yeah I had an x ray when I was having back problems What did the X-ray reveal We do a maneuver when babies are first born to see if they have hip dysplasia bc if it’s caught in infancy they just need to wear a harness Mine wa neg Jyoti had one done at some point which was also negative Ohhhhh Do I ask for a dysplasia x-ray? Lol is that even a thing You can always ask your pcp! They can order one for you to check Ahh okay My Dr is kinda sketch I have to find a new one lol Anyone can order one to rule out hip dysplasia. I had all these back problems so they had to rule that out when I mentioned it to them Ahh got it. Thanks for the pro tip lol Does Alex have a gig tmr night? We r meeting Sharon's niece tmr at the kids museum to do a noon "countdown" lol. Which honestly is perfect Yeah he took one in the city and stranding me with the 2 kids lol It’s fine it’s socialization for him we haven’t had any real plans for NYE for a while We usually do a countdown on YouTube before bed for Leila! Awww Lately we have been asleep before 11 on NYE lol Lol such a cute face though Who is that?? Sharon's stepmom's daughter's son Patrick Lol He’s cute!! Oh lord Damn those sitches Poor thing Also what cool shirt is aurora wearing - the blue one with a painted lady Well Scott is also covering his tracks in case he gets asked why aurora has stitches Patrick is a cutie lol it was bound to happen to us - getting sick It looks like Kamala Harris lol That's what I thought!!! Lol I want one lol True he could also maybe not depend on someone who uses a cane Same with Gemma Yeah lol also preferably not 70+ I would never even think of burdening someone who uses a cane to watch my kid I know!!! It's too close to the circle of life lol Aurora can't come to the twins bday party unless Gemma is invited 😪 Is she invited? Unfortunately no lol Tisha and ding r going to the party. Gemma is going to watch Aurora God forbid she spends time with her kid Yeah too bad aurora can't come to the party I know Gemma needs to do better and make amends I wonder what her relationship is like with Scott now 😬 Hopefully amicable for the sake of aurora I don’t know why she isn’t more mad at him for taking advantage of her parents Bc she probably takes advantage of her parents lol Pot meet kettle Lol Also she doesn't have a leg to stand on. He is watching/providing for her 5 out of the 7 days Hahaha I know right Fricking terrible Are you guys leaving tomorrow? Yeah r flight is earlish so we'll beat the storm 🤞 Oh yeah shit!!

Lol Loll we already ate so much of the food Hahajajha I got our babysitter a mini shovel and ice scraper bc she just got her license like 2 months ago Hahhaha She is a baby I think Steven said the twins bday is gonna be low key anyways right? Maybe by next year he will do the whole kid party thing Yeah bc they don't really have friends Lol Probably next year for sure I don’t think Aurora is missing too much I do feel bad tho she’s been excluded bc her mom is Gemma Yeah I think so too. Plus no one is going to remember Yeah that parts sucks *part Yeah agreed they won’t remember But might be gemma 's strategy going forward 👀 I’m sure Steven will pull out all the stops in the coming years. They already had to plan a whole wedding lol And succeeded! You mean like to get on good graces I feel bad for aurora. She should get to know all her cousins More like, if I'm not invited to anything neither is aurora Yeah there’s not really anyone out there besides Steven Love bluey! She better kiss his butt Blueys has adult themes! New bluey coming out soon!!!

His body was badly decomposed They can be annoying depending on what the med is If insulin dependent then yeah he has to inject himself w/ every meal And check sugar Insulin doesn’t really have side effects but he may have been on a pill for type 3 Type 2*** Was he overweight? Not really overweight I would say he looked fit maybe a little overweight Hm Interesting Diabetes isn’t really one of That’s sad So tragic I remember his dad He passed away in the same apt Who is giving you this info?

Possible lol The ride wasn't bad It's just if ur train was delayed it screwed *ur screwed bc u had to transfer three times The 14 ppl on the jury with me were blue collar and didn't have a BA That was interesting and they get their news from FB and local news and Instagram lol Fascinating I def sounded like a liberal elite lol That sounds awful Are they allowed to pick juries like that???

It was 35 each way Omg Not even Round trip! Whoops Lirr is expensive Metro north is expensive Both r not affordable jebus I started to just walk to stations in the Bronx bc it’s like $5 cheaper Yeah def $15 one way Good god They at least stopped making it cheaper to buy round trip on the metro north For better or worse Lol jeez There’s no peak vs off peak fares though if you travel within Westchester/bronx it’s literally $4.25 one way So much cheaper Oh good The peak off peak is nuts Luckily I was off peak Tell me what u think of this. So this weekend a friend of alex came over with his daughter and this time he brought his wife. She’s Chinese but did college in USA and is a French/Chinese teacher in mamaroneck. She was so strange and very self obsessed. Was asking me why I went to a Caribbean medical school, why a nurse can’t do my job, told me if she was a doctor she would be a plastic surgeon etc etc 🙄 She is annoying I entertained her questions even tho I was slightly insulted at her insinuations. Alex thinks it’s cultural I said no, I have met plenty of ppl from China who are so respectful and normal ppl Is she mainland china Yes North China She is rude 😂 I would have said so ur a commie right So I’m feeding Augie in his room and I go back to the basement where everyone is I hear a flush in our master bathroom I mean ur from chi - na like how trump says it The hallway bath is completly unoccupied Is that weird??? Umm yeah That's straight rude if she didn't ask I was like that would not be my go to She didn’t ask She is an entitled brat She had the nerve to even ask me what my mortgage payment was I was like that’s actually none of your business She is straight a tita Oh food Good What did she day She was like “oh” I'm like bitch mind yo business Bc she was ballparking some figured And I was like no it’s not that Lol So she said what is it She sounds like auntie evelyn And I said I’m not willing to tell you Looool At least I know Evelyn I haven’t met this person ever and I’m getting interrogated She is annoying and I'm sure it not the only one who thinks that Ur out of pocket lady No I think her husband is slightly onto her bc when our other friends came over she just sat in the basement and was on her phone But I was like yeah let’s not invite her over Ok I was really put off by it bc I was trapped at home with her No she is off putting But come to think of it- she never asked where the bathroom was So she was snooping around Wiw Wow The audacity She actually used the master bathroom twice. Once before she left So entitled 😂 Also the main bath was unoccupied then too 🙄 Don't ever invite her back Next time she comes lock the door I had like my underwear hanging in our bathroom lol Lock the master room Next time I’ll just feed Augie in our room Whateves that's what she gets I’ve met her kid before but not her. Daughter is a sweet but big time tattle tale lol All of Leila’s friends tattle on her lol No one likes a narc kid I feel kinda bad for that little girl 😬 Yeah I actually felt the same way too She’s gonna have like a tiger mom A real one She’s really into ballroom dancing strangely The mom I would have been like why? What a weird hobby? Lol Give her taste of her own medicine She’s obsessed with it actually She goes to a studio in thornwood Lol It’s strange. She said ppl Anyways 🙄 LOL Ive been ruminating as I usually do Sure Jan 🙄 all over the "world" Process it then let go I don’t come into contact with ppl like that typically so I never know if I’m being too sensitive I need to start therapy again lol Lol no she was out of pocket Like rude Tell Alex she is not allowed back lol I know I feel bad bc the daughter likes to play with Leila And I get the impression they don’t know many ppl here But I don’t think I’ll invite them over Maybe they can go to a playground when the weather gets nicer I hate being forced to talk to other moms just bc I’m a woman Yes and u can lose her in the jungle bars lol I’m like come on Augie time to walk Life is too short to put up with ppl u don't have to Whoops he pooped again. 🤷🏽‍♂ So I can chase him and not have an excuse to get cornered Exactly Yeah agreed 💯 Outdoors is good There is a time limit Maybe she is on the spectrum? Lol 🤣 She could be! Honestly after watching that show I’m like wow I know a lot of people who prob have autism Or she is just Chinese lol That s true especially women But I feel like I can’t generalize Chinese ppl so all be superficial like that It's not so obvy I think it’s maybe unique to a certain class of Chinese women The wealthy U can generalize lol it's ok The commie money If she went to school in the us Her family def has gov connections She did college and grad school in USA Her high school was in China And the us charges a lot to foreign students Where did she go to school I’m not too sure She probably went to a boarding school or international school She is a high school teacher U should have asked so did u matriculate from Harvard? Why not lol Also why r u just a teacher?? And not a professor Lol Honestly I’m surprised to meet a Chinese person interested in a career in teaching? Is that weird to say? Yeah usually academics they go into I don't think it's weird but def not the norm Or finance business She must be a disappointment to her family Science etc Lol French 🥖!!! Lol She said she was interested in liberal arts She is probably hector the projector 📽️ Yeah I’m trying not to take it personally obviously But I’m like I need therapy Yeah it's hard I don’t need to explain myself to these obnoxious ppl Exactly I need to set boundaries with strangers U don't anyone a  god damn thing *owe I need to find a new therapist tho it’s been a while Setting boundaries is hard I read a lot of advice columns for fun I learn a lot lol Where do you find them? I read ParentSnark on Reddit lol. I find it therapeutic Nyt wapo They r getting into the advice business It’s a forum to snark on Instagram parent influencers Reddit is fun I liked it for animal crossing I feel like the advice columns give u practical advice During dark pandemic days I would find other islands to go to on Reddit lol Like how to set boundaries Lol reddit is unfiltered stuff like the real truth I think I need some work to recognize when ppl are walking all over me bc it’s better to confront in the moment Yes Instead of what I do which is taking it and them ruminating on it for days Yes address it at the moment It's hard And tricky I've read that when u don't address it right away the other person might be like why didn't u say anything then By that time the moment has passed Yeah I had that happen with my friend Victoria And then I convince urself that ur being crazy Or too sensitive I decided to bless and release her as a friend *u Victoria.... Have I met her She’s a skinny black girl. Grew up in NyC Maybe not She was at my wedding And some ppl r in ur life for only a period Very pretty Oh I remember her Tall and skinny She’s not super tall but she’s very thin Very fashionable I dont remember her face but def her name We studied abroad together Ahh What happened Was she out of pocket lol She low key shaded my education at a Caribbean medical school Bc her friend (who I helped and provided moral support to) Got into a suny medical school Uggg I was like oh ok now I know you think lesser of me and my career Yeah fuck her lol The fact that ur a board certified doctor 🏥💊 Sorry jas ppl r messed up I know. Again idk why I need to explain myself to ppl It’s a little more insidious coming from an old friend So I let her go Yeah she sucks Oh good Do you know ppl who are only children and who act like it She’s like that Alex is too but less so 🙄 Red flag Alex not so much I've seen worse lol When we went to Senegal she wanted a ring so bad she had me give her most of my cash so she could buy it Bc she never carries cash Lol Me want now Only child syndrome Exactly Alex forgets to change toilet paper rolls That’s the worst Emotionally he is very aware Lol that is the worst It's especially egregious at night lol Ur half asleep and trying to pee I know!! I have to point it out Like it's bad lol Ok I gotta prep for my 1:1 at 3 Take it easy Good luck getting home!!! Thanks lol How was the play date with Quinn? Jun invited me but I have to work They had a great time! Minimal arguing They played for like 4 hours straight. I told Jun to just leave her here! She’s self sufficient. I’m always home bc Augie still takes 2 naps Awww Did ur mom come by Yeah ofc She brought them dim sum and matching outfits 🤣 Classic Awww Amma is the best lol From my mom 🤣 What hour was it when they started eating lunch? They look tired lol Lol ur mom Kalat! Quinn was nauseous from the car ride so they didn’t eat until like 1:30-2 Poor Quinn. Been there girl not fun She basically ate air Doesn't dramine help She didn’t want a snack either and Leila does whatever she does so she ate so much for dinner LOL I'm glad they r close enough in age that they can play Yeah it was great! Minimal arguing. Jun brought a pair of Gabby’s doll house cat ears that they argued over, it got mad heated but luckily we have the same pair 🤣 Lol crisis averted! Also good to argue teach them early Confrontation is not a bad thing LOL The Asian culture is sons ated of confrontation I’m so glad they’re the same age. Leila plays with a lot of older kids and they all tattle on her *scared of I never know what to say So true Tattle on her ! Lol What do they say? Jerks Lol A bunch of narcs lol Yeah! It’s so redic. They’re like Leila hit my knee with the stick and it’s usually an accident or something silly like that Leila didn’t pass her vision screen at school so she may need glasses lol Aww Lol 🙄 you'll be fine kid sheesh Tell Leila all the cool kids were glasses I started to wear my glasses more!  🤓 Naked baby pics bc who doesn’t love those 🤣 Such a smiley baby This can't be good for their health It's a crazy amount of food ppl r recording themselves eating Wtf I hate listening to ppl eat Anything for the likes! 🙄 I guess if ppl pay to subscribe. Yes I hate the sound of ppl eating lol. That's just hell for me No lies tho that food looks good I love food lol American Chinese food is amazing I missed it so much when I lived in Grenada I bet! When sharon and I r traveling, after a few days of eating American food, I usually say I need some Chinese S.T.A.T or Asian food at least. We r watching 90 day fiance and there is a story line with a Malaysian woman and this American guy. She was like I miss Malaysian food bc it's flavorful and spicy! American food is bland lol. And the Malaysian language is similar to  tagalog. We were like they sound Filipino lol Omg is this old 90 day finance or new Leida is bonkers This one is the most recent one. Lol I’m watching you are what you eat and there’s a set of Filipino twins Most of the couples are so volatile. I love that show 🤣 Sharon and I r always like thank God we get along Lol It’s always disconcerting how many Filipinas are on that show lol Can't beat the weather Quick question so it seems like caz has rsv? They r both coughing and sneezing poor things They can't sleep straight through 😣. I have to monitor them at night, it's not likely that either would stop breathing right? 🤔 The only being that slept soundly was Mila lol I fell asleep for a few hours and was worried that someone stopped breathing! I've been listening to my mom watching Filipino shows. OMG so hilarious. The hosts r talking about how pogi "si Asher" (usher lol), "silent qui-tting", cuffing season! Lol And a Filipino lady is singing "I will buy myself 🌺" by Miley Cyrus! These shows r actually keeping our parents in the "know" culturally at least That’s so funny! Lol ur mom What’s she watching?

She watched a game show where contestants have to name all the ingredients in a halo halo lol I mean personally I love TFC If I bought cable I would totally subscribe Lol Wowowwee is hilarious I don’t even know if it’s on the air I remember that show lol https://www.instagram.com/reel/C31jIvosQzD/?igsh=eG5qeXNwZG05Ym9w This is cracking me up Lol this sounds like my mother How are the boys doing?

Time out I think but no one does it lol Palo? 🩴 I just have to stand my ground and not give in to the "😭" We do time outs, they are kind of non punitive They’re kind of young tho Redirection is probably better at that age Steven said to do time outs but ur right they might be too young “Look at this shiny thing!!!” Lol Is that Mila barking???? lol Lol probably She is soo cute Did your mom show you this No lol oh my word I was like, what ancient medieval torture device is that 🤣 That’s Nanz grandson Is it suppose to help him walk Lol lol yeah I would be so embarrassed to take that out in public Lol Just let the kid figure it out on his own Seriously lol They probably saw it on youchube Youchube 🤣 What are the names of the shows your mom watched on tfc I want to looo them up on the app Let m ask her There's def a game show I like the game shows I can’t with some of these titles 🤣 Lol I AM U lol wtf is that show Kelly looks like a family member lolz Lol Cute pic!!

Do you have American coworkers there That’s so funny No American co workers Everyone is either Polish or Ukrainian That’s probably why they think the Korean food is good But also maybe think that you’re Korean Right?

Deposition for Gemma? Yeah For full custody My mom thinks Scott wants Gemma to pay child support And wants ding and Tisha to turn against her Asking for child support is fair Since Scott has aurora most of the time Things r getting ugly Yeah that’s ugly But he is silly Seems like he is lashing out. Which I can understand Ding and Tisha do a lot of childcare and financial support Maybe not day to day financial support but food clothes etc Yeah but it should be from Gemma not her parents Gemma is still skating by Yeah true I would not want to violate their agreement They are much more reliable than Gemma at this point Poor aurora How’s Gemma gonna get more money anyways Do they have to lawyer up Yeah for sure It’s April 2 Messy I think my mom gave Steven a heads up lol Tsk tsk Google stylized my birkenau death camp photo!

We really missed our kitchen Luckily the board covered most of it We were showering with our dishes lol What even happened? A leak? A small pipe between my unit and next door had a small hairline fracture Honestly the whole thing could have been handled better. I'm going to talk to the board. When the leak first appeared no one knew what to do. 🙄 It was raining water in the foyay First we tried to get into the apt where we though the leak was. But no one had the key The lady was in Manhattan Oh god We should have turned the water off first To minimize the damage But no one knew how to do it!! Yeah makes sense LOL Instead we called the fire department Omg And they only turned off half of it Did this poor woman’s apartment get totally wrecked? Luckily no The leak wasn't from her It was the pipe between me and unit next door Ooohh I feel like calling the fire dept is probably not a good use of resources Then the plumbers couldn't quite figure out where the leak was from so they were punching holes in the walls HAHA oh god. Why is it so complicated I'm like we send a rocket in space and no one knows how to id a leak!?!!! Hahahahahaha C’mon people!! There is actually an instrument u can buy!! Like we don’t pay plumbers enough SMH Yeah the whole thing was so frustrating Exactly They could have turned off the water immediately And limited the damage and th cost I'm running for board president!! Lol LOL that sounds awful Yeah it was terrible I'm creating a Google doc that shows pics of where all the values r located Hahahaha And have everyone turn in a key I don’t get why they don’t have these keys It's a miracle this place is still functioning I mean maybe bc of the thefts? I know! They actually asked for keys and I gave them an extra one For some reason no one knows what happened to them Yooooo That’s fishy They asked us for extra keys bc someone died in their apt (a long time ago). They had to break down the door. Which is why they asked for keys lol Oh what should I bring for ur dad Yes I remember you told me about that Nothing! Maybe flowers lok It’s a non birthday party 🤣 They’re doing cupcakes for like Steven my mom dad.

Poker face at the bday party Yeah you know her….stoic She puts up with a lot I’m sure her knee still bothers her too She spent all morning and afternoon working in her garden last week with her friend Yvonne Nothing stops her She is a beast - ur mom I know lol Beast mode lol My dad is all hype over the eclipse and she like can’t even be bothered She’s like- I already saw one 🤣 Lol tell her we won't be able to see another for another 20 years So alex and I looked up full solar eclipses and there was a total solar eclipse in the Phils in like 1956 or something Whoa They probably thought God was punishing the ppl lol Alex said that she should be excited bc it’s probably going to be the best time to go to Costco LOL I think this was the one https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_June_20,_1955 I’m gonna pick up leila early. We were hoping she would forget but she’s super excited about my mom’s bday and the eclipse. I know I’ll be regretting this decision by 4pm Lol she is super pumped on a Monday! She wouldn’t stop talking about it to alex on the way to school. Between this and the earthquake she’s got a lot of material these days 🥴 Lol Awww she has so many thoughts!! Luckily my mom is letting us celebrate her birthday bc I guilted her that Leila’s excited 🤣 Oh yeah!! What r u guys doing Hopefully just a cake and candle We made a card last night Steven sent 3 dozen roses so I think she’s covered Awww Did she send this to you? Oh snap it's happening No she hasn't mentioned it Yeah they worked on the weekend too apparently It looks so much better Lighter! I know so much lighter and airy Those panels were dark When is it gonna be done I know. Initially they were going to just paint over them but then they changed their minds I think they said 10 days Can't wait for the big reveal! Loool Like a 🍌? Yup 🍌 It was so cool! The glasses make all the diff I’m glad you guys got some Sharon likes to be prepared I got our glasses like a month ago I knew everyone would be looking for them now Did Leila like it OMG Sharon dad is so funny. He is currently watching a science show about eclipses LOL #relevant This girl is like begging me to sleep over at their house It mom? Lol Look at all that yummy cake Epic Also Jollibee chicken sandwich is legit good Better than shake shack. Do not try their Korean chicken sandwich it's terrible I tried both the shake shack ones they were v disappointing And the fries Ofc there’s a jollibee there The s shack was terrible. It's like they just decided to slather sauce on top of a fried chicken and call it Korean fried chicken Home improvements! Master bedroom and family room Looks amazing I didnt realize they were also going to do the master bedroom I think it was a last minute decision but I’m glad they did it Yes tis was time LOL I saw that and I was like 🙄 It was cool to tbh Tho* Lol I'm a huge eclipse fan She’s going on a week long retreat in Italy (?) Are you guys still in VA? I think Tisha and ding and Jay are coming to nyc Yup nice and warm So cool! The moon and the earth shot is sooo cool When r they coming? Sat Ahh I can't see it I think bc Jin is alone with the kids and Jay is coming? Oh good Give the other grandkids some Amma time R they staying with ur mom Yeah I think so Sharon and I have been here 3 weeks. We can see the upside of living with family Idk how long Jay is staying or where Someone is always at the house Oh yeah Are you staying at their house? Or hotel Yup at the house 3 bedrooms It’s nice you can share resources Her dad sleeps in the living toom Yes and u don't feel so lonely Split the cooking, errands etc Exactly It's not so bad They have a huge backyard I think you have to make sure you have a space to be alone Like you don’t have to be in the common areas all the time Other wise you’re together 24/7 and that gets old Exactly Lil gal is named ☕ Is the American way wrong? Lol I think we might do spring in VA It's warm and sunny You mean like living alone vs multi generational living? Yeah You have to really be ok with spending so much time with family Lol I was totally fine living with my folks for like 6 months and especially after my mom fell but I was the one who couldn’t take it after a year It’s so annoying to have dinner with them every night though we had a lot of opportunities to go out to eat on our own Lol maybe a house close to each other is the best option We enjoy dinners with her dad and step brother lol lol no it truly is even tho my mom comes over sometimes 3x/ day 🥴 Her dad is super easy peasy. Although Sharon gets annoyed lol. My dad is conservative too so we just kept talking circles at dinner lol understandable! She opened a wine bottle and her dad was like r u getting drunk I think it’s sometimes easier as a SO Yead def Bc you know your limits and they don’t push your buttons I don't get annoyed It's different if ur the child It’s definitely worth it to save the money in many ways Food, rent etc It's good that I'm here. I have to tell Sharon to chill Hahaha yeah for sure The parents wanted to give Sharon and her brother these old ass heavy tables It was worth it when Leila was a baby. We could leave her at home and go do whatever after she was asleep Hahaha No thanks How far away does Jon live? They were like no it's so heavy This was soooo heavy Sharon and I had to grab it from the shed It's tile!!lol lol They wanted to also give them these Italian porcelain lamps. The figures were like Louie the 16th and Marie Antoinette lol Omg Bulk waste yo Or buy nothing Sharon's nieces tried to feed it. She was like why won't the little man eat We tried to see if we can sell it on ebay But there r so many ones available on eBay lol Such a waste Filipinos loves that shit Hahaha Cheap furniture? Oh you mean the porcelain lamps Yeah they want their homes to be like an Italian villa lol Heavy ass shit and porcelain pepo IAM living the washer/dish washer so much Dude it’s amazing My mom ran into JJ randomly in Boston They had plans to meet for dinner tonight She said he was with his coworkers and he didn’t introduce her lol Lol Umm what is ur mom doing in Boston And did Jay say this is some random old lady I met on the street That's so random lol She’s with my dad for a conference Ahhh.

Yeah they’re keeping on top of things I think It’s a lot to manage Dialysis is hard Yeah that’s way hard It’s like a total lifestyle change Hopefully we'll have a magic pill by then lol Or artificial kidneys Yeah I'm just gonna make Casey give me his lol That’s why god gave us 2 🤣 Exactly 😂 I feel bad for Sharon step brother. He is only 38 And his doctor said his kidney r not functioning at all He might have to start the dialysis center treatment Rn he has a machine at home They deliver all the liquids to the house So many boxes Already That’s insane We tried to move them but it's so heavy That’s tragic Yeah it's really sad He is a nice guy Just got dealt shitty cards So Sharon’s step mom is dealing with both of them? Yup God bless her Someone is always in the Emergency room He must have something Some genetic condition It might be genetic or something That’s way too young Yeah He is on the transplant list 🤞🤞 No siblings right? Two actually Hmmm I didn't even think about that They may not be matches Yeah. It's also a hard ask They may have some the condition too but just not as bad Hopefully That sucks!!!! Alright gotta run home or fast walk rather lol Brb Ok good luck I have to put Augie to bed anyways ! He is so cute. I cant I totally paid for the bubble tea.

What's uraro It’s these cassava cookies. They sucked. I gave them back to Zeny So dry I got some ☕️ Gemma and alex broke up The Australian guy? She living with Tisha and ding again Oh noooo I think so? That's not good for anyone Did u hear this from ur mom Lol Yeah Ofc Tisha called her Yeah not great Shit I'm scared lol I hope she’s getting her shit together At least she spends more time with aurora? This might be a triggering event Yeah I think Tisha is trying to suss that out She needs to not depend on me Men* Lol word I think Tisha feels like Gemma doesn’t care about Aurora It's strange that out of all the women in our family she is the only one that is the exact opposite Hahaha yeah I know right I can see that. Gemma is like trump Trump gives two shits about his children except Ivanka lom Yeah so idk some arguments and what not happening lol I feel bad for Tisha and ding I think Tisha was feeling guilty that Gemma is not “successful” I want to feel bad too but they also enable so much It's complicated 😭 Yeah fa sho. I just feel bad tho cuz they are old lol I wish Gemma peace Yeah me too. And aurora to be alright So ding and Tisha did not tell Jun about gemma Oh they didn’t oops When Jun tried to check the home cam, Uncle ding changed the settings lol lol wut So he couldnt see anything Ugh Why are they trying to hide that Where else is Gemma gonna live lol I know right! Lol They r gonna start complaining soon Who else is going to listen to them but jun Yeah 😑 Lol Its so funny We ordered from this Asian online store lol Great pics thank you!! Zeny would be down to try any Asian snacks! We tried role Costco oysters Did you eat those We haven't tried it yet lol How was the Costco oysters I guess Gemma and aurora randomly showed up at the playground where the boys were playing yesterday. Jyoti was there and said aurora played with the boys which was nice. Also Steven lives close to her ex's house lol. Steven did say, the playground near his house is rated one of the top playgrounds lol. They were weird but tasty? Weird texture Also my mom just sent Steven and that what's app 😆 I'm particular about my oysters. They have to be tiny They are tiny Your mom is being so hard on Tisha! Oh lol I thought they would be the big ones But they were prepackaged I think they were oysters? Idk if you came to my parents house over Easter but my mom had Jun and I try them Yeah my mom likes to dish advice but when it comes down to it, she isn't going to act differently They taste like old chewing gum  bonito flakes Hmmmm Like the dried squid We went to the Costco in VA omg so many amazing Asian food Like they had some good shit. If we stayed longer we would have bought more lol When they have Asian stuff it’s so good! So good. All sorts of fun stuff I feel bad for Tisha and ding they have a very close relationship with Aurora They want the best for her They’re in such a lose-lose situation Yeah I agree but I also think I hope she isn't going to turn out like Gemma. I don't think they've reflected on their parenting skills lol They’re basically the only stability she has There’s basically no way she can turn out like gemma Yeah poor Aurora. And for god’s sake she’s 3. They’re gonna do what they’re gonna do she’s 3. Gemma is like 33 lol I'm hopeful she is gonna be ok Gemma is 36! Jun told me lol Oy Yeah that makes sense hahahap Oops She should just do gig work I guess she is a bad employee lol no one to renew her contract The gig economy is perfect! Short stints *wants Yeah but to be in the gig economy you have to have something to offer lol Or do Uber eats She can be a Dasher or uber I ordered an Uber to drive me to ur house. He made his app tell me to put my seat belt on. He didn't say a damn thing to me lol They’re pork less chicharron I've had something like it from trader joes It was soo good Lol mang Juan!

Then I look out in the hallway and ppl r leaving their condos. So we decide to evacuate. In the staircase these two old ppl with canes r walking down the stairs. Clearly they r too old to be walking down. So we try as best as we could to help them. They were struggling. The lady couldn't stand up by the time we were on the first floor. They live on the 10th. So Sharon had to get a wheelchair and we helped her get on the wheelchair and wheeled her home. 😭 It turns out to be a false alarm I don't know if those two would have made it if not for us. Lol There is this broad city episodes where they end up moving into a senior home in Florida lol. That is us LOL Omg Jfc This condo is full of old ppl Lol That’s nuts!!!

They told her it was cancelled Turns out she didnt have the right rezzie number lol What Yeah I don't know where she got the random reservation number from lol I told her to just call them it’s like Filipinos answering the line lol LOL hoy! Jun and I have been obsessive about the weather lol. We r set to fly out on Sat but there r flurries. Hopefully nothing major I know I saw! Bleeg My flight is the first one 730 am 🤞 Girllllllll 😖 It’s more the wind than the snow imho Ugg I hate the wind Augie's first 🍦 Have u guys boarded? Hope it wasn't too crazy Just boarded. Good god Are you home? Just landed. I also had flight delays and barely made the flight lol. Safe travels I should have taken pics of the dolphin while we were waiting! Lol Orion! I told Sharon about the trip and she said it sounds like u guys were all at semester at sea LOL Finally in a taxi on the way home. Thought we wouldn’t make it back here. Leila had a pee pee accident and Augie was awake the whole time 🥴 You had flight delays?? It’s super foggy here and misty It seemed like everyone who booked Delta with a connection has flight delays. Jun was the only one who didnt bc it was direct Aww Augie doggie. Hope he gets a good night's sleep and Leila too. Omg Hey jas how r things? How r the cutie kiddies? U guys r about to be zeny free for a couple of weeks. She told me she is going to the Philippines for a party 🥳 Yo! We are good! Hanging in there sort of. Yeah she’s leaving Sunday night I just finished serving jury duty for a criminal case they ended up taking a plea bargain Jyo tore her ACL did you hear about that? Yeah ur mom asked if I ever tore my ACL. I said thank goodness no I can't believe u got chosen for jury duty I made it to the second round but got dismissed. Me too. This guy who was a retired lawyer for a financial firm got chosen too It wasn’t bad I just don’t like the unpredictability The charges they read were for dwai and driving without a license and I think assaulting a cop I had to go to Long fucking island which was far lol The guy who was a lawyer said that the defendants get nervous when they see the jury being assembled Do they not have a courthouse in Brooklyn? wtf I remember that This was for federal Oooob that makes more sense I was surprised by the education level of the jury duty Yeah same It was humbling to hear everyone’s demographics lol Aww he is growing up I assume u had more educated ppl? In my round it was really like me and the lawyer Most didn’t have a college education I was one of the more educated ppl with a professional job Yeah same Yes I was shocked I was gobsmacked There was like sanitation workers retail workers I was like I do live in a bubble and I love it lol Ppl with associates degrees or technical school I know we totally do All the ppl who worked there were really nice, the judge and all the clerks were so thankful They really drive home the guilt factor to make you sit through the rounds of jury selection I got so lucky though I was only ever there for 1 full day out of 4. They canceled 1 and then let us go early It all counted towards service Yeah I think I only went one day But I had to call in every night to check to see if I had to report back Oh that’s annoying The federal one - no phones lol The whole time??? Yes No phones at all I don’t want to get called for federal I was so determined to see this jury duty through How are you guys doing? I really wanted to get picked Waiting for warmer weather and daylight savings time We missed you when Steven was here Are you traveling this summer? Oh yeah that was in January I think I might go back to Europe. Sharon is traveling a lot  but I don't have the vacation days lol. She is going to Asia in April, Europe in june Australia in the winter and Saudi in the fall. Oh wow For work or pleasure Fortunately for work lol They pay for everything Daaaaang That’s awesome! Everything so expensive I was trying to look into Lego land for the kids and it’s like $1k for their lodging and park fees That's crazy Yeah for like 4 days or something I was like nvm LOLLLOLLLLL Just do what we did a couple of years ago get the full cargo hold experience!! *include Like what? Lol I know we might just do round trip or stay off site at a hotel, Augie has no stamina so we would only be there for a few hours anyways What the hell is that lll I do like the lamp. Multipurpose 🤣 It's like a temu Disney decor? The lamp is super cool lol Are ur parents having an anniversary thing in April? They’re calling an earth day party lol My dad is at least 🤣 April 20 I think Or 19th I think You know like a nonspecific way to celebrate birthdays Lol Sooooo shy But yeah same deal as last year Sweet! Love indian food lol I think Steven and the kids r going to be there I think so too I’ll see if everyone’s down to do an Easter party and egg hunt on Sunday or afterwards !!! Where in Europe are you going to this time? Hmmm def Germany but maybe Portugal. Once ur there it's easier to bop around Everything is maybe three hours max by plane I wouldn't mind the south of France again. Super chill and everyone carries a baguette in their purse lol R u guys going anywhere with the kiddos I don’t think so maybe Legoland or beach It’s not so bad in the summer Time we aren’t as cooped up indoors Yeah.. the winter is tough We take them swimming at the gym on Sunday’s they have open swim hours for families It’s exhausting but fun It will tire them out lol Are you still WFH? Unfortunately no. Lol. I have to go into the office two days a week. It gives me a chance to pick up take out. That's the only upside 👀 Oh snap I gotta see the inside It looks amazing Also 1.1m Sheesh I know right ! It looks amazing I can’t believe what a dump it was before They did a good amount of work Did anyone actually live in it There aren't a lot of pictures What a tease No one lives in it There’s lots of pics!!! They were house flippers Oh I only saw three on Zillow Yeah it burned down over the summer too lll No there’s like 50 Maybe bc I have an app? Ahh I don't have the app I'll look when I get home This should be ur parents home! Lol The bedrooms r huge I know right??! Like HUGE It’s pretty nuts It's deceptively big I'm impressed They did a lot of work Did I show it mom lol *u I sent it to her! Lol The beds look tiny bc the room is large Their bedroom is weird One was super large Almost comically large You have to walk up stairs to get to the master Oh I see It's a weird little house This is the before My eeysy Eyes The pink tile and the slime green paint color There was so much water damage Their daughter grew up in that house Yeah u can tell It looks a million times better now Still weird But at least it's nice and airy The previous owner was trying to make a driveway and a parking spot around the back yard Like basically a driveway btw my parents house and their house Ohh But to make like an embankment they ripped out pieces of the house like a bannister and threw it in the backyard to make it flat So there’s been just junk in the backyard for years Lol With critters hiding I think they were hoping to fill it in with concrete? Idk Oh I see The garage is still there but leveled The two patios is kinda weird Connected by a staircase It’s kind of weird but the backyard is sort of unusable They cleaned up the back nicely It's a lot of lawn Augie and I went with my dad to the open house lol Is it Dad looking to move? Lol The agent was looking to hook him! It was impressive I mean the entire thing is completely new. Pretty soul less ofc but new Lol ahh that's where the little couch lives in the master bedroom I couldn't figure it out They had this fancy ass mirror in the master bath With the little door I feel like Ohhh It’s hard to tell which rooms which right ? They’re all exactly the same Yeah it was hard. I couldn't figure out the configuration Styled the exact same way It will probably get snatched up. Lol double checking before I click on the link I clicked on it it’s a google link I think the more likely thing is that he’s confused Oh no Maybe he meant to paste it in a different thread The snack names kill me Yo don’t sleep on the Irvins salted egg stuff It’s delicious They have it here I haven seen sales egg cornflakes but the fish skins are delish Also that packaging lol lots going on Hahahahha Yes the fish skins r sooooo good I wanna go to Singapore! Like crazy rich Asians Pretty sure there is a minion copy right infringement happening there Sharon said the food is surprisingly bland 🤣 But I think she is trying to eat clean and healthy I do wonder if we eat like Americanized versions of Singaporean food here I mean boneless chicken feet how is that even possible Sorcery R u guys doing anything fun with ur mom Ew Leila wants to cut a cake with her so she’s going to get herself a cake (sigh)because she’s going that way anyway and if that isn’t the Zeny-est thing that ever happened then idk But they’re gearing up to go to Philly tomorrow bc my sisters having surgery on Thursday So she’s doing some last minute panic shopping Apparently the house next door is going  for over 1.1 mill She is letting me buy the cake 🤣 <This message was edited> Small miracles My 7th grade health class taught me nothing What!
