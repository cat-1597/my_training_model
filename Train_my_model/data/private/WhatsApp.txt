2/5/24, 1:59 PM - Jas Hands: But I don’t think I’ll invite them over
2/5/24, 1:59 PM - Jas Hands: Maybe they can go to a playground when the weather gets nicer
2/5/24, 1:59 PM - Jas Hands: I hate being forced to talk to other moms just bc I’m a woman
2/5/24, 2:00 PM - 😺: Yes and u can lose her in the jungle bars lol

2/5/24, 2:02 PM - 😺: That s true especially women
2/5/24, 2:02 PM - Jas Hands: But I feel like I can’t generalize Chinese ppl so all be superficial like that
2/5/24, 2:02 PM - 😺: It's not so obvy
2/5/24, 2:02 PM - Jas Hands: I think it’s maybe unique to a certain class of Chinese women
2/5/24, 2:02 PM - Jas Hands: The wealthy
2/5/24, 2:02 PM - 😺: U can generalize lol it's ok

2/20/24, 7:01 PM - 😺: I bet! When sharon and I r traveling, after a few days of eating American food, I usually say I need some Chinese S.T.A.T or Asian food at least. We r watching 90 day fiance and there is a story line with a Malaysian woman and this American guy. She was like I miss Malaysian food bc it's flavorful and spicy! American food is bland lol. And the Malaysian language is similar to  tagalog. We were like they sound Filipino lol
2/20/24, 8:48 PM - Jas Hands: Omg is this old 90 day finance or new
2/20/24, 8:48 PM - Jas Hands: Leida is bonkers

2/28/24, 4:29 PM - 😺: Quick question so it seems like caz has rsv? They r both coughing and sneezing poor things
2/28/24, 4:31 PM - 😺: They can't sleep straight through 😣. I have to monitor them at night, it's not likely that either would stop breathing right? 🤔 The only being that slept soundly was Mila lol
2/28/24, 4:31 PM - 😺: I fell asleep for a few hours and was worried that someone stopped breathing!
3/1/24, 8:39 PM - 😺: I've been listening to my mom watching Filipino shows. OMG so hilarious. The hosts r talking about how pogi "si Asher" (usher lol), "silent qui-tting", cuffing season!

3/22/24, 1:58 PM - 😺: We were showering with our dishes lol
3/22/24, 1:58 PM - Jas Hands: What even happened?
3/22/24, 1:58 PM - Jas Hands: A leak?
3/22/24, 1:59 PM - 😺: A small pipe between my unit and next door had a small hairline fracture
3/22/24, 2:00 PM - 😺: Honestly the whole thing could have been handled better. I'm going to talk to the board. When the leak first appeared no one knew what to do.
3/22/24, 2:00 PM - Jas Hands: 🙄
3/22/24, 2:00 PM - 😺: It was raining water in the foyay
3/22/24, 2:00 PM - 😺: First we tried to get into the apt where we though the leak was. But no one had the key
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - 😺: The lady was in Manhattan
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - Jas Hands: Oh god
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - 😺: We should have turned the water off first
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - 😺: To minimize the damage
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - 😺: But no one knew how to do it!!
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - Jas Hands: Yeah makes sense
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - Jas Hands: LOL
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - 😺: Instead we called the fire department
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - Jas Hands: Omg
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - 😺: And they only turned off half of it
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - Jas Hands: Did this poor woman’s apartment get totally wrecked?
3/22/24, 2:01 PM - 😺: Luckily no
3/22/24, 2:02 PM - 😺: The leak wasn't from her
3/22/24, 2:02 PM - 😺: It was the pipe between me and unit next door
3/22/24, 2:02 PM - Jas Hands: Ooohh
3/22/24, 2:02 PM - Jas Hands: I feel like calling the fire dept is probably not a good use of resources
3/22/24, 2:03 PM - 😺: Then the plumbers couldn't quite figure out where the leak was from so they were punching holes in the walls
3/22/24, 2:03 PM - Jas Hands: HAHA oh god. Why is it so complicated
3/22/24, 2:03 PM - 😺: I'm like we send a rocket in space and no one knows how to id a leak!?!!!
3/22/24, 2:03 PM - Jas Hands: Hahahahahaha
3/22/24, 2:04 PM - Jas Hands: C’mon people!!
3/22/24, 2:04 PM - 😺: There is actually an instrument u can buy!!
3/22/24, 2:04 PM - Jas Hands: Like we don’t pay plumbers enough SMH
3/22/24, 2:04 PM - 😺: Yeah the whole thing was so frustrating
3/22/24, 2:04 PM - 😺: Exactly
3/22/24, 2:04 PM - 😺: They could have turned off the water immediately
3/22/24, 2:04 PM - 😺: And limited the damage and th cost
3/22/24, 2:05 PM - 😺: I'm running for board president!! Lol
3/22/24, 2:05 PM - Jas Hands: LOL that sounds awful
3/22/24, 2:05 PM - 😺: Yeah it was terrible

3/22/24, 2:06 PM - Jas Hands: I don’t get why they don’t have these keys
3/22/24, 2:06 PM - 😺: It's a miracle this place is still functioning
3/22/24, 2:06 PM - Jas Hands: I mean maybe bc of the thefts?
3/22/24, 2:06 PM - 😺: I know!
3/22/24, 2:06 PM - 😺: They actually asked for keys and I gave them an extra one
3/22/24, 2:06 PM - 😺: For some reason no one knows what happened to them
3/22/24, 2:06 PM - Jas Hands: Yooooo
3/22/24, 2:06 PM - Jas Hands: That’s fishy
3/22/24, 2:07 PM - 😺: They asked us for extra keys bc someone died in their apt (a long time ago). They had to break down the door.
3/22/24, 2:07 PM - 😺: Which is why they asked for keys lol
3/22/24, 2:07 PM - 😺: Oh what should I bring for ur dad
3/22/24, 2:07 PM - Jas Hands: Yes I remember you told me about that
3/22/24, 2:07 PM - Jas Hands: Nothing!

5/13/24, 8:24 PM - 😺: <Media omitted>
5/13/24, 8:24 PM - 😺: I guess Gemma and aurora randomly showed up at the playground where the boys were playing yesterday. Jyoti was there and said aurora played with the boys which was nice. Also Steven lives close to her ex's house lol. Steven did say, the playground near his house is rated one of the top playgrounds lol.
5/13/24, 8:24 PM - Jas Hands: They were weird but tasty? Weird texture
5/13/24, 8:24 PM - 😺: Also my mom just sent Steven and that what's app 😆

5/13/24, 8:28 PM - Jas Hands: They’re in such a lose-lose situation
5/13/24, 8:29 PM - 😺: Yeah I agree but I also think I hope she isn't going to turn out like Gemma. I don't think they've reflected on their parenting skills lol
5/13/24, 8:29 PM - Jas Hands: They’re basically the only stability she has
5/13/24, 8:29 PM - Jas Hands: There’s basically no way she can turn out like gemma
5/13/24, 8:29 PM - 😺: Yeah poor Aurora.

They were struggling. The lady couldn't stand up by the time we were on the first floor. They live on the 10th. So Sharon had to get a wheelchair and we helped her get on the wheelchair and wheeled her home. 😭
